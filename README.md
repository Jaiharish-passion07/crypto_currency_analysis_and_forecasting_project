I'm certain that everyone is aware of it. Nevertheless, I'll give a brief introduction to it.
We learn about things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and 
Solana every day. Cryptocurrency is a brand-new generation of digital money that
offers decentralized finance free from the control of the banking system. It has 
a consensus algorithm and uses blockchain technology as its backing. The market for cryptocurrencies worldwide is $1.07 trillion.
