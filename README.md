# Cryptocurrency Analysis and Forecasting Project

I'm certain that everyone is aware of it. Nevertheless, I'll give a brief introduction to it.
We learn about things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and 
Solana every day. Cryptocurrency is a brand-new generation of digital money that
offers decentralized finance free from the control of the banking system. It has 
a consensus algorithm and uses blockchain technology as its backing. The market for cryptocurrencies worldwide is $1.07 trillion.


## Goal of the Project

1. Forecasting the bitcoin price in future
2. Why is bitcoin the king of cryptocurrency?
3. Analysis of bear and bull market in each month for every year from 2013 to 2022
4. Which country's market impacts the crypto currency market?

 And still further more analysis will be updated on upcoming days...
## Appendix

This project's study and price prediction mostly focused on the price of bitcoin. Because of its Marketcap, Bitcoin is regarded as the king of the cryptocurrency market.
For additional investigation, we use altcoins such as

- Ethereum
- BNB
- XRP
- Cardano
- Solana
